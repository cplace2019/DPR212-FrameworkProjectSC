0FP: FRAMEWORK PROPOSAL PHASE

For the Framework Proposal phase,  I conducted research to find a Java framework to used to develop a Java application.  I selected a Java framework and a Java application to develop.  I submitted the included proposal for approval for my framework project.

PROPOSAL FOR FRAMEWORK PROJECT

For my framework project, I would like to work with one of Java's client technologies to create a calculator program.

The JavaFX is the framework I would like to use.  JavaFX is Java?s next-generation client platform and GUI framework that provides a powerful, streamlined, flexible framework which simplifies the creation of modern, visually exciting GUIs.

The calculator program will allow users to perform basic calculation functions such as addition, substration, multiplication and division.  If time permits, as a second phase I am hoping to built additional functions into the calculator program.

I estimate about three weeks to create a calculator program with the basic functions mentioned above.
