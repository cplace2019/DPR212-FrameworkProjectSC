2FD: FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT PHASE

For the second phase of my Framework Development,  I continued to research, read, study and learn how to fix and enhance  my CalculatorFX using the JavaFX Framework.  The source code, the freedcamp file and a screenshot of the JavaFX application for this phase is included in this phase's branch on Github.
