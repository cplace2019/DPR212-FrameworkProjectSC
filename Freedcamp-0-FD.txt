I continued to utilize Freedcamp to create tasks for the work that needed to be completed for my Framework Project.

Learn
-How to get started with JavaFX
-Found JavaFX Doc: JFXST.pdf release 8, E50606-02, August 2014.
-Use JFXST.pdf to learn how to get started with JavaFX
Needs
 - Based on JFXST.pdf the needs are: Java SDk 8, Netbean IDE (a version which supports JavaFX) and the JavaFX samples (need to be downloaded from Oracles website)
-JFXST.pdf - understand it, to get started with JavaFX
-Java SDk 8 - already installed
-Netbean IDE - version 8.2 installed already.  
-JavaFX samples - downloaded
-work through only the samples needed to start developing my calculator app,  will return to additional samples later.
-review existing calculator app model from our textbook - ch11sec01_we01calc
Design 
-Work through what's needed for my CalculatorFX app such as textfield, digit buttons, operation buttons, label, grid layout and the GUI based on my proposal
Code

-Next start coding in the button events and calculations needed
Project
-create the CalculatorFX project in NetBean from existing source code - see the GitHub readme CalculatorFX
Compile
 -compile the CalculatorFX source code
-work through the issues - I'm getting many warnings from the IDE for code that should work based on the JavaFX getting started document.  I tried reworking the code, recreating the project and many other things to compile the source code until something works.  
-Note issues to be researched at a later time.
Run
 -run CalculatorFX app, test digit buttons and operation buttons to see if working correctly.
-Note issues to be researched at a later time.
Github 
- No posting at this time.  I need to detemine the source of the problems I'm experience with  JavaFX and the NetBean IDE.
Submit
-Submit CalculatorFX source code in canvas for my Framework project assignment for now   I need to determine why the JavaFX framework is not working as it should in the NetBean IDE.
