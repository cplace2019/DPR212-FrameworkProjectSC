CalculatorFX

For this framework project, I used one of Java's client technologies: JavaFX to create a calculator program.  

JavaFX is Java's next-generation client platform and GUI framework that provides a powerful, streamlined, flexible framework which simplifies the creation of modern, visually exciting GUIs.

The CalculatorFX program allows users to perform basic calculation functions such as addition, substration, multiplication and division.  It provides the following:  digit buttons,  operation buttons, a clear button and a display to show results.  

GETTING UP AND RUNNING 
 
To get the CalculatorFX program up and running first you need to set up the JavaFX application environment (see P1 below).   Next create a CalculatorFX project in the NetBean IDE (see P2 below).   Then you can compile and run the CalculatorFX Project (see P3 below). 


P1: SETTING UP THE JAVAFX APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT

You need to have the JavaFX runtime libraries on your machine before you can run the CalculatorFX project.

To get the JavaFX runtime libraries install the latest version of JDK8 on your machine.

A Java development IDE is needed to compile and run the CalculatorFX source code.    The integrated development environment (IDE) I used which has support for JavaFX applications is the NetBean IDE.   
You will need to download and install NetBean 8.2.

P2: CREATING A CALCULATORFX PROJECT IN THE NETBEAN IDE.

To run the CalculatorFX program  in an IDE, I have provided the CalculatorFX source code which needs to be compiled from within a NetBean JavaFX Application project.

1. Download the CalculatorFX source code along with image files to your machine inside the following windows folder structure created in the NetBean document folder:
CalculatorFX/src/calculatorfx.

Go to the NetBean document folder on your machine.
FIRST:  create a folder called CalculatorFX in the NetBean document folder.
SECOND, create a folder called src inside the CalculatorFX folder.
THIRD: create a folder called calculatorfx inside the src folder.
The calculatorfx is the package folder declared in the source code.  Place the CalculatorFX source code along with image files in the calculatorfx package folder.

2. Launch the NetBean IDE on your machine.
3. From the file menu then  choose new project.
4. In the JavaFX application category then choose JavaFX Application from existing source code.
5. Name the project CalculatorFX and click Next.
6. When you get to step asking for your existing source code  select Browse to locate the CalculatorFX folder created in step 1 above and click Next.  
7. Verify that the existing source code was found in the src folder.  If correct click Next.  If not correct fix your folder structure to match the folder structure  created in Step 1.  Go back to the step asking for your existing source code.  Browse to the  CalculatorFX folder and reselect it then click Next to get back to this step.
8. Accept the defaults for all other steps and click Next until you get to step with the Finish.
9. Click Finish to create the project.


P3: COMPILING AND RUNNING THE CALCULATORFX PROGRAM

1. Once the project is created  right-click on the CalculatorFX project in the File view and select Compile.
2. Wait for the CalculatorFX project to finish compiling. Right-click on the CalculatorFX project in the File view. Select Run.
3. Wait for the CalculatorFX program to launch in a Java runtime window.  Select the Java runtime window for the CalculatorFX program.
4. Enter the first number by clicking on the digit buttons (for instance 100).
5. Enter the operation by clicking on a operator button (for instance the * for multiplication).
6. Enter the second number by clicking on the digit buttons (for instance 5).
7. Select the equal button by clicking on the = button.
8.  Wait for the display to update to show the answer.
9.  Click on the Reset button to enter new numbers. Wait for reset to finish. Repeat steps 4 through 8 above.
